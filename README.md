# Moinsen Punch Cards

A Flutter application that processes and interprets punch card images, demonstrating the capabilities of AI-assisted programming. This project was primarily generated through AI assistance, with minimal manual programming intervention.

## About

This project serves as a demonstration of what modern AI (specifically Claude) can achieve in software development. The application:

- Processes images of punch cards
- Detects hole patterns
- Interprets instructions
- Executes the interpreted code
- Provides a modern, interactive UI

## Features

- Multiple image input methods:
  - Select from gallery
  - Take photo with camera
  - Paste from clipboard
- Interactive image viewer with zoom and pan capabilities
- Real-time hole pattern detection
- Instruction interpretation
- Program execution
- Step-by-step workflow
- Modern Material Design UI

## AI Generation

This project was generated with the assistance of Claude (Anthropic's AI), demonstrating:
- Complex Flutter UI implementation
- Image processing algorithms
- State management
- Error handling
- Cross-platform compatibility

The vast majority of the code was AI-generated, with minimal human intervention mainly for:
- Project initialization
- Dependency management
- Minor adjustments and bug fixes

## Technical Details

The application is built using:
- Flutter/Dart
- Image processing libraries
- Native clipboard integration
- Material Design 3

## Getting Started

1. Ensure Flutter is installed on your system
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
4. Run `flutter run` to start the application

## Dependencies

- flutter_svg: ^2.0.17
- image_picker: ^1.1.2
- image: ^4.5.3
- path_provider: ^2.1.5
